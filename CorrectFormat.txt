review/summary: Pittsburgh - Home of the OLDIES
review/text: I have all of the doo wop DVD's and this one is as good or better than the
1st ones. Remember once these performers are gone, we'll never get to see them again.
Rhino did an excellent job and if you like or love doo wop and Rock n Roll you'll LOVE
this DVD !!
